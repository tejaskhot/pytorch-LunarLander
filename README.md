# pytorch-LunarLander
PyTorch implementation of different Deep RL algorithms for the LunarLander-v2 environment in OpenAI Gym

We implemented 3 different RL algortihms to solve the LunarLander-v2 environment:
1) Imitation Learning
2) Reinforce
3) Advantage-Actor-Critic (A2C)

Note: Imitation Learning is implemented in Keras and the other two algorithms in PyTorch
